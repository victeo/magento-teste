# Magento Demo

This project aims to demonstrate advanced development skills in Magento 2.4, with a focus on creating a responsive layout and using all the tools available, including LESS, XML, Knockout.js, jQuery, PHP, among others.

## Main Features

- Responsive Layout: The project was developed with a fully responsive design, providing a consistent user experience across different devices and screen sizes.

- Theme Customization**: Theme customizations were applied using LESS to style the elements of the store, ensuring a unique and attractive appearance.

- Home Page Configuration**: We used XML to configure the structure of the homepage, including static blocks, sliders and featured categories.

- Interactivity with Knockout.js and jQuery**: We incorporate interactivity into the page using Knockout.js to manipulate dynamic data and jQuery to enhance the user experience.

- Custom Module Integration**: We develop custom modules in PHP to add specific functionalities, such as integration with third-party services or customization of checkout processes.

## Project Structure

The structure of the project follows the best practices of Magento 2.4:

- `app/code`: Contains the custom modules developed for the project.
- `app/design`: Stores the layout, template and style files for the custom theme.
- `pub/static`: Contains the static files (CSS, JS, images) after compilation.
- `var`: Directory for temporary files, such as logs and cache.
- `view/frontend/web`: Contains the JavaScript, CSS and image files specific to the front-end.
